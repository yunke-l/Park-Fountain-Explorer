# Park-Fountain-Explorer
Python course project at NEU, 2022 fall semester.

This project serves the purpose of identifying parks with available free drinking fountains within each neighborhood in Vancouver. The dataset on parks and fountains come from 'https://opendata.vancouver.ca'. This project is implemented in Python, utilizing the tkinter library to construct a graphical user interface (GUI) and employing the matplotlib library for data analysis visualization. Additionally, the project includes a comprehensive set of unit tests for all its classes and functions.
 
To engage with the program, execute the 'data_dashboard.py' file to launch the GUI.
